# AI for Inquiry - The Question Improver Agent ðŸ§ 
The purpose of the Question Improver Agent is to enhance the quality and depth of questions posed by users. Utilizing a sophisticated algorithm that incorporates a diverse range of expert personas, the agent systematically refines and restructures initial questions. Through this process, it produces more insightful, thought-provoking, and comprehensive questions that are better suited for in-depth exploration and discussion in various domains, such as academic research, business strategy, or personal inquiry. This tool aims to foster deeper understanding and more meaningful dialogue by elevating the art of questioning.

This project recently won 1st place at an AI for Thought Hackathon at AGI House SF.

#### Premise:
Effective questioning is at the heart of great thinking and decisive action. In complex situations with many trade-offs, quality questions are crucial. This tool creates a self-reinforcing cycle: deeper understanding leads to more insightful questions, which in turn fosters even deeper insights

#### User Experience: 
Input complex question -> auto-selects expert personas -> graph of thoughts reasoning -> output improved question -> Repeat as needed!

#### Components:
- Initial Problem: Complex issue with multiple trade-offs
- Persona Library: A diverse range of expert personas for simulations
- ðŸŽ¶ Graph of Thoughts Reasoning Rhythm
	- Multi-Persona Expert Selection: Automatic and dynamic, based on the nature of the question
 	- Self<>Peer Criticism
 	- Evaluation
  	- Expand, Explore, Branch, Network
  	- Convergence on Best Individual Answer
  	- Convergence on Best Collective Answer
  	- Retrospective
- Output: A refined, more insightful and though-provoking question
- Optional: Loop through this multiple times as a chain of graph of thoughts, each time iteratively improving the question until diminishing returns

#### Error Correction includes:

- **Incorporating Explicit Error Checking:** Includes a specific stage for the experts to identify potential errors in their reasoning and correct them. This is an explicit part of the criticism stages.
- **Encouraging Divergent Thinking:** During the expand, explore, and branch stage, the experts are encouraged to not only build on their current thoughts, but also to think divergently and consider entirely new lines of reasoning.
- **Adding a Retrospective Stage:** After the final convergence on the best answer, a reflection stage has been added. Here, the experts can discuss what they learned from the process, identify key takeaways, and suggest how they might approach similar problems in the future.

Synthesize the insights and critiques into a cohesive and compelling answer from each expert's viewpoint.

Reflect on the entire dialogue, considering how each criticism was addressed and how your thoughts evolved.
Your answer should not only represent your strongest position but also acknowledge and integrate valid and useful insights from the other expert perspectives.
        
Based on all this, as each expert, what is the single best answer to the question: {question}?
```

## Prompt 7: Convergence on Best Collective Answer

### Goal
Synthesize the best individual answers from the experts and arrive at a single final, most helpful/accurate/likely answer.

### Prompt
```
Facilitate a synthesis of the individual experts' answers to forge a unified, comprehensive and impressive response. 
This collective answer should encapsulate the most salient points from each expert, demonstrating a 
harmonious integration of diverse perspectives. Aim for a conclusion that is not only insightful but 
also balanced and representative of the collective expertise.

The synthesized answer should not be formulated in explicit terms specific to each persona's own agenda, 
but rather it should be phrased in a way that seeks to inspire and uncover broad, general, deeper truths, 
regardless of what personas happened to be involved in this discussion. 
A great answer will transcend the limited view of any one expert, so the answer shouldn't be phrased as such.
```

## Prompt 8: Retrospective

### Goal
The Retrospective phase is a crucial part of any reasoning or problem-solving process. It provides an opportunity to learn from experience, improve future processes, and deepen understanding of the problem or question at hand. It's a fundamental mechanism that enables compound growth/learning. 

Appending a Retrospective phase to a reasoning process gives the LLM (and human) an opportunity to review and analyze the holistic process. This can also help inspire future iterations of more refined prompts and ways to improve the blueprint itself.
