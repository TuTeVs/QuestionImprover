# AI for Inquiry - The Question Improver Agent ðŸ§ 
The purpose of the Question Improver Agent is to enhance the quality and depth of questions posed by users. Utilizing a sophisticated algorithm that incorporates a diverse range of expert personas, the agent systematically refines and restructures initial questions. Through this process, it produces more insightful, thought-provoking, and comprehensive questions that are better suited for in-depth exploration and discussion in various domains, such as academic research, business strategy, or personal inquiry. This tool aims to foster deeper understanding and more meaningful dialogue by elevating the art of questioning.

This project recently won 1st place at an AI for Thought Hackathon at AGI House SF.

#### Premise:
Effective questioning is at the heart of great thinking and decisive action. In complex situations with many trade-offs, quality questions are crucial. This tool creates a self-reinforcing cycle: deeper understanding leads to more insightful questions, which in turn fosters even deeper insights

#### User Experience: 
Input complex question -> auto-selects expert personas -> graph of thoughts reasoning -> output improved question -> Repeat as needed!

#### Components:
- Initial Problem: Complex issue with multiple trade-offs
- Persona Library: A diverse range of expert personas for simulations
- ðŸŽ¶ Graph of Thoughts Reasoning Rhythm
	- Multi-Persona Expert Selection: Automatic and dynamic, based on the nature of the question
 	- Self<>Peer Criticism
 	- Evaluation
  	- Expand, Explore, Branch, Network
  	- Convergence on Best Individual Answer
  	- Convergence on Best Collective Answer
  	- Retrospective
- Output: A refined, more insightful and though-provoking question
- Optional: Loop through this multiple times as a chain of graph of thoughts, each time iteratively improving the question until diminishing returns

#### Error Correction includes:

- **Incorporating Explicit Error Checking:** Includes a specific stage for the experts to identify potential errors in their reasoning and correct them. This is an explicit part of the criticism stages.
- **Encouraging Divergent Thinking:** During the expand, explore, and branch stage, the experts are encouraged to not only build on their current thoughts, but also to think divergently and consider entirely new lines of reasoning.
- **Adding a Retrospective Stage:** After the final convergence on the best answer, a reflection stage has been added. Here, the experts can discuss what they learned from the process, identify key takeaways, and suggest how they might approach similar problems in the future.
