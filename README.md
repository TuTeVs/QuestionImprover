# ðŸ§  AI for Inquiry - The Question Improver Agent
The Question Improver Agent is an LLM-driven "tool for thought" designed to elevate the quality and depth of user-posed questions. It utilizes a novel reasoning algorithm integrating diverse expert personas and a graph-based reasoning rhythm to systematically refine questions, making them more insightful, thought-provoking and suited for in-depth exploration across various domains, such as academic research, business strategy, or personal inquiry.

This tool aims to elevate the art of inquiry, fostering a cycle of deepened understanding, more meaningful dialog and progressively insightful questioning.

This project recently won 1st place at an AI for Thought Hackathon at AGI House SF, showcasing how we can enhance cognitive processes using creative AI techniques.

### Motivation: 
> How to navigate the Information Age through better questions

The premise for this agent is that in an age where information inundates and overwhelms us, the ability to ask the right questions is more crucial than ever.
- the meta-skill and art lies not in amassing answers, but in crafting good questions
- the caliber of questions often dictates the value of the answers we uncover
- the right questions can even be more illuminating than the answers

The QuestionImprover Agent harnesses this principle, creating a virtuous self-reinforcing cycle where enhanced understanding leads to ever more profound questions, thereby fostering even deeper insights.

This repo consists of 
- a persona library that I've started to define
- all the prompts used so you can try this with your own questions in a UI like ChatGPT
- simple python example in a Jupyter notebook implementation using Langchain to help orchestrate the prompt engineering

## ðŸ§¬ Agent Cybernetics: The Inner Workings

> These feedback loops are iterative and dynamic, with each loop informing and shaping the subsequent ones. They create a rhythm of continuous improvement and learning, ensuring that the conversation remains adaptive, responsive to new information, and oriented toward deeper understanding and inquiry.

1. **Initial Insight and Critique Loop**: Each persona provides initial insights specific to their expertise, laying the foundation for the reasoning process. This loop establishes the primary perspectives and sets the stage for the conversation. This is followed by a critique phase, where each persona critically evaluates their own and others' insights. This loop of insight and critique ensures that each perspective is not only articulated but also challenged and refined.

2. **Adaptation and Expansion Loop**: After receiving critiques, each persona adapts their insights to incorporate this feedback. This loop focuses on evolution, where personas reassess and reformulate their ideas, creating a more nuanced and comprehensive network of interconnected thoughts.

3. **Integration and Synthesis Loop**: The personas then synthesize their evolved thoughts into individual conclusions, striving to converge on the best answer. This loop involves distilling the collective wisdom into coherent positions that reflect the integration of all perspectives.

4. **Convergence and Divergence Loop**: The process then moves into a phase where personas explore new, divergent ideas stimulated by the previous feedback loops, followed by a convergence phase where these ideas are brought together into a unified, comprehensive response. This loop allows for the exploration of novel concepts and the integration of diverse thoughts into a cohesive narrative.

5. **Meta-Analysis and Reflection Loop:** The conversation crescendos in a meta-analysis, where each persona reflects on the effectiveness of the interconnected thoughts, the dynamics between personas, and the adaptation to critiques. This loop is critical for evaluating the reasoning process itself and identifying opportunities for future improvements.

6. **Question Refinement and Enhancement Loop:** Finally, the initial question is refined based on the insights gained through the networked reasoning process. This loop focuses on transforming the question into a more insightful and universally engaging form, encapsulating the essence of the collaborative thought process.

### There are three primary layers of feedback loops:

1. **User Input and Response Feedback Loop**:
    - Initial Input: The user starts by posing a question to the system.
    - Agent Processing and Output: The AI processes the question through its multi-layered reasoning rhythm, outputting a refined question.
    - User Evaluation and Feedback: The user evaluates the refined question, assessing its depth, relevance, and clarity. Users can modify the agent's prompts to better suit their specific context or inquiry goals.

2. **Internal Layer Feedback Loops**: These occur within each major phase or component of the methodology. Examples include:
	- The interaction and critique within the expert persona selection and interaction phase.
	- The process of self and peer criticism, where personas evaluate and refine their own and each other's insights.
	- The evaluation and expansion phase, where feedback leads to the exploration of new ideas and the refinement of existing ones.
	- The idea integration and network building within each persona's thought process.

3. **External Layer Feedback Loops**: These are the loops that connect different phases of the methodology, ensuring that insights and improvements from one phase inform and enhance subsequent phases. Examples include:
	- The convergence and synthesis loop, where the insights from individual and collective convergence phases are used to refine the question and the process itself.
	- The retrospective and iterative improvement loop, which reflects on the entire process and informs improvements for future iterations.
	- Iterative Refinement via Chain-of-Graph-of-Thoughts: Based on the user's goals, iterate through the reasoning process again from the beginning, inputting the recently improved question to make it even better. This chains together individual Graph-of-Thoughts rhythms, where the outcome of one cycle informs the starting point of the next.

These layers of feedback loops interact with each other, creating a dynamic, interconnected system. The internal loops ensure depth and rigor within each phase, while the external loops ensure that the entire process is cohesive, adaptive, continually improving, and aligned with human goals.

question.

As each expert persona, reflect on the following:

1. Interactions and Dynamics: Reflect on how the various stages and components of the reasoning process
interacted with each other. What synergies or conflicts emerged? How did these interactions influence the
direction and quality of the final outcome?

2. Adaptation and Response to Critique: Evaluate how the process adapted to new information and critiques.
How effectively did the system and the personas respond to feedback? Were there significant shifts in
perspective or approach, and what impact did they have on the reasoning process?

3. Confidence and Convergence: Assess your confidence in the final answer. How did the convergence phase
contribute to this confidence? Were all insights and perspectives adequately synthesized?

4. Meta-Learning and Future Application: Shifting focus away from the question itself and zooming out on the
holistic conversation quality, persona definitions and applicability, reasoning rhythm and overall
methodology, please identify any key learnings or specific opportunities for improvement on the meta-process
itself. Anything specific to modify that could be improved or approached differently in subsequent iterations
that would lead to an improved reasoning process, regardless of the initial question? Any specific
enhancements to any of the feedback loops?

This retrospective analysis is not just a conclusion but a stepping stone for future reasoning and inquiry.
Your reflections are invaluable for enhancing the effectiveness of this reasoning process and for enriching
our understanding of complex questions!
```

### ðŸ’¡ Prompt 9: New Enhanced Question
