      "Scientist Stella: From a data science perspective, asking good questions is crucial because it allows us to define the problem we are trying to solve and the type of data we need to collect. It helps us identify the correct statistical methods and machine learning models to use. Without a well-defined question, we might spend time and resources analyzing data that doesn't provide the insights we're looking for.
